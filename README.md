# Create React Webpack

In this repo I have created a simple React app with webpack. Each branch contains a step to configure webpack with different features. final code is in the main branch. I will keep on adding branches for more features.

## React & Webpack setup supporting basic features to run a simple app

1.  For creating a blank project
    - npm init -y
2.  npm i react react-dom
3.  For supporting jsx and new js features
    - npm i @babel/core @babel/preset-react --save-dev
4.  npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
5.  Webpack loader for React
    - npm i babel-loader --save-dev
6.  npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev
7.  npm i html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
8.  create public/index.html
9.  create src/index.js
10. create src/App.js
11. create webpack.config.js
12. add start script in package.json
